A Few notes for you. This has automatically generated tables of contents, figures, and tables. This uses Bibtex referencing, so have a little look at that. (Download mendeley omg). It is ready for binding as far as I'm aware, the binding offset is already in place, so print away. (Perhaps do the first 5 pages first on duplex, just to double check though!!). Good luck, and may the force be with you.
